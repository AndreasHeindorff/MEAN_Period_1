/**
 * Explain the use of "use strict"
 * The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
 * With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
 *
 * Variable/Function-Hoisting
 * In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
 * In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
 *
 * "this" in JavaScript
 * One of the most confusing concepts is the ‘this’ keyword.
 * In most languages, ‘this’ is a reference to the current object instantiated by the class.
 * In JavaScript, ‘this’ normally refers to the object which ‘owns’ the method, but it depends on how a function is called.
 *
 * Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern
 * The module pattern makes use of the feature in JavaScript "closures".
 * In order to give you some control of the privacy of your methods,
 * so that third party applications cannot access private data or overwrite it.
 *
 * Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
 * Immediately-Invoked function expressions can be used to avoid variable hoisting from within blocks,
 * protect against polluting the global environment and simultaneously allow public access to methods,
 * while retaining privacy for variables defined within the function.
 *
 * JavaScript Prototyping
 * Every JavaScript object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object.
 * All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.
 *
 * User defined Callback Functions
